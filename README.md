To install and run the .NET Core Web API built on .NET 8.0, follow these detailed steps:

1. Install or Update to .NET 8.0
Before running the Web API on your local machine, ensure that you have .NET 8.0 installed. If not, download and install the latest version from the official .NET website.
2. Configure SQL Server Express
This API uses SQL Server Express for both Authentication and Task Management. You need to update the Windows Authentication connection string in the appsettings.Development.json file. Locate the connection string section and modify it to point to your local SQL Server instance. It might look something like this:
json
Copy code
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost\\SQLEXPRESS;Database=YourDatabaseName;Trusted_Connection=True;" - your connection string
}

3. Apply Migrations
The API uses Entity Framework Core for database migrations. To set up the database schema, you need to apply the migrations. Open the Package Manager Console in Visual Studio and run the following commands:
1.	Update Identity Migration: This applies the migration for user authentication.
bash
Copy code
update-database IdentityMigration -context AuthenticationDbContext
2.	Seed Roles Migration: This seeds roles into the database.
bash
Copy code
update-database RoleSeedMigration -context AuthenticationDbContext
3.	Update Task Management Migration: This sets up the database schema for task management.
bash
Copy code
update-database TaskMigration -context ApplicationDbContext
4. Build and Run the Application
After applying the migrations:
1.	Clean the Solution: This removes any old binaries or cached files.
2.	Build the Solution: This compiles the code and ensures there are no errors.
3.	Run the Application: You can run the application by pressing F5 in Visual Studio or using the command line:
bash
Copy code
dotnet run
5. Access the API
Once the application is running, you can access the API endpoints through your browser or a tool like Postman. The base URL is typically https://localhost:44375/ 
By following these steps, you'll have the .NET Core Web API running on your local environment, connected to your SQL Server Express database.
